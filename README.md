Helpful examples for Netbox

I beat my head against the wall today attempting to change the `Status` for IP addresses. It wasn't clear that the status needed to be lower case. I have examples here which show how one can change different attributes for the Netbox ipam items. If it saves anybody time and frustration, then putting information here will have been my contribution to world happiness.

I'll try to add more examples as I proceed figuring out the different APIs and their nuances.
